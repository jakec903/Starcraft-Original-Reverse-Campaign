# Starcraft Original Reverse Campaign


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Starcraft Reverse Series
       Created by: Happy115
Special Thanks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ViC Brigade - He is the developer of the Coop Campaign. Due to difficulty of finding the
campaign maps and starting features, I used the starting template of the Coop maps and
modified them into single player and modified the triggers from there.

MindHawk - He is working and came up with the idea of the Starcraft II Wings of Liberty
Reverse Campaign.  This series is inspired from it.

Basic Installation Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I only know the Windows 10 system and the installation will be based off this.

Unzip contents in the following location to play:

Basic Info:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is run on Starcraft Broodwar.  While most maps will work on Original Starcraft, some
maps use assets from Starcraft Broodwar, thus it is suggested to run on game on the
expansion version.

About the Maps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- These set of maps consist of the Original Starcraft Campaign. Some use assets from Broodwar
  such as Dark Templar in the efforts of the AI being able to consistently kill Cerebrates.

- Not all Missions are available. Specifically installation missions or "Hero Missions" are
  not provided and will most likely not be done.

- Mission Briefs have been modified to reflect a "General" objective of what to do.  These
  mission briefings may not be accurate but hopefully provide some substance (Some are repeated
  more than others).

- Roles of the Traditional Campaign will be swapped and modified.  This means that the campaign
  you choose will be the main enemy you must fight.  Due to this, the starting forces for your
  side will be reduced and the AI's side will be increased.

AI Changes and Difficulty:

- AI Power levels are significantly stronger.  Furthermore, majority of AI have access to ALL
  normal campaign units (This both makes the AI stronger and prevent the AI from breaking).
  In some cases, there will be additional AI to make the mission more difficult whether they
  are escort waves to protect the Zerg Chrysalis or generic attack waves.

- Difficulty level is approximately the same as "Brutal" difficulty from Starcraft II. This
  may vary depending on the person and map.

- Some missions will involve having an ally AI (This is due to multiple computers and bases
  in the original campaign).  These AIs are significantly weaker than the Enemy AI counter
  part and will eventually be overwhelmed if not supported. This means the enemy AI will
  should always have an opportunity to win.

- The missions themselves are not balanced around progressive difficulty.  Some earlier
  missions may be significantly harder than later missions.

Maps and Objectives:

- Most objectives will be to prevent whatever the original campaign wanted you to do.
  This means if you are required to prevent Dark Templar from escaping, you will be required
  to escort them to safety instead.

- Some objects have been added or modified and some areas are also modified.
  (I.E. Norad III crashed site has a Terran Base, which is harder to destroy)

- Majority of Maps have been given additional resources for gathering.  This is due to
  both increased difficulty and limited bases located near the AI in the Original Campaign

Other:

- If you wish to report a bug or have questions, please message me at itsthatguy115@gmail.com
  I will do my best to try to check occasionally and update when needed

- I will continue to create the "Broodwar Reversed Campaign"
